day 1- Introduction to Node.js

What is Node.js ?
-> Nodejs is open source, cross platform runtime environment for developing server side and networking application 
server means middleware 
What is client server architecture ? 
-> its a computing model, where server hosts, distribute and controls the mejority of the resources as well as services to used by the client, 
-> Such structural designs are made up of one or more client systems connected to main servers through a network(internet-connections) 

Three tire arc.

Client -> Browser/Mobile apps
    HTML/css/JavaScript 

server - Middleware (req/res)
    Java/.Net/C++/PHP/Nodejs

Backend - persistant layr
    oracle, mysql/sql/sql server/ MongoDB/Cassandra

What is Module
-------------- 
Module is a functionality which is organized in single or multiple javascript file and can be reused throughout the nodejs application

Types of Module
--------------
1.Core modules : these are the modules which are in-built and you can use without any installation 

2. npm : these include a group of modules or packages, developed by other developers,which can be used in your application by installing them 

3. User defined modules : These are the modules which are created by you, which you want to reuse in rest of your application

Core modules
------------
1.fs : it handles the file systems
2.path : it handles the file systems
3.buffer: it handles the binary data
4.http: it makes node.js act like an http server
5.url: it parses the URL strings 
6.util: it is used to access the utility function 
7.Os : it gets information about the os 

why to go for NPM ?
-------------------
you have to write your own codes.
write test cases for it to make sure there are no edge cases
maintain codes as node progresses over time.
